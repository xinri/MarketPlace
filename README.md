# MarketPlace #

## Background ##

Per Wikipedia, "an offer is a proposal to sell a specific product or
service under specific conditions".

As a merchant I offer goods for sale.
I want to create an offer so that I can share it with my customers.

All my offers have shopper friendly descriptions.
I price all my offers up front in a defined currency.

An offer is time-bounded, with the length of time an offer is valid for
defined as part of the offer, and should expire automatically.
Offers may also be explicitly cancelled before they expire.

## Assignment ##

You are required to create a simple RESTful software service that will allow a merchant to create a new simple offer.

Offers, once created, may be queried.

After the period of time defined on the offer it should expire and
further requests to query the offer should reflect that somehow.

Before an offer has expired users may cancel it.

## Guidelines ##

The solution should be written in Java or Scala
The merchant should be able to interact with the service over HTTP
No restrictions on external libraries

Submit as a git repository (link to GitHub, BitBucket, etc)
We are looking for a simple solution representative of an enterprise deliverable
Use TDD

Please pay attention to OO design; clean code, adherence to SOLID principles
As a simplification offers may be persisted to a file, embedded database or held in
memory

You can ignore authentication and authorization concerns
Feel free to make any assumptions and document in a README markdown file, or
otherwise, with the submission
